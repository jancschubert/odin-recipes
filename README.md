# Odin Recipes 

This is a solution to the HTML practice project of the Foundations
Course of The Odin Project.

This is a pure practice program to integrate basic HTML 5 knowledge
with a basic git workflow, as well as publishing the result on
Github Pages.

I'm going to limit myself to basic HTML 5 markup and only a slight
amount of CSS, and point out each bit of functionality that I used
if it is beyond the scope of the HTML foundations already learned.

In addition, the goal is to practice doing git commits so they pro-
vide a useful history by doing them at the proper times as well as
writing clear, concise commit messages.
